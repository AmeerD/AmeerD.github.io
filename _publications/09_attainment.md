Abstract: Education is a key driver of social and economic mobility, yet disparities in attainment persist, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Existing indicators, such as mean years of schooling for adults aged 25 and older (MYS25) and expected years of schooling (EYS), offer a snapshot of an educational system, but lack either cohort-specific or temporal granularity. To address these limitations, we introduce the ultimate years of schooling (UYS)-a birth cohort-based metric targeting the final educational attainment of any individual cohort, including those with ongoing schooling trajectories. As with many attainment indicators, we propose to estimate UYS with cross-sectional household surveys. However, for younger cohorts, estimation fails, because these individuals are right-censored leading to severe downwards bias. To correct for this, we propose to re-frame educational attainment as a time-to-event process and deploy discrete-time survival models that explicitly account for censoring in the observations. At the national level, we estimate the parameters of the model using survey-weighted logistic regression, while for finer spatial resolutions, where sample sizes are smaller, we embed the discrete-time survival model within a Bayesian spatiotemporal framework to improve stability and precision. Applying our proposed methods to data from the 2022 Tanzania Demographic and Health Surveys, we estimate female educational trajectories corrected for censoring biases, and reveal substantial subnational disparities. By providing a dynamic, bias-corrected, and spatially disaggregated measure, our approach enhances education monitoring; it equips policymakers and researchers with a more precise tool for monitoring current progress towards education goals, and for designing future targeted policy interventions in LMICs.
