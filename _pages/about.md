Hello, my name is Ameer. I am currently a PhD in Biostatistics Student at the University of Washington working as a Research Assistant under Professor Daniela Witten. Previously I worked for two years as a research and data consultant for the [Global Education Monitoring Report](https://en.unesco.org/gem-report/) at UNESCO. Before then, I completed by Master of Science in Statistical Sciences at the University of Toronto where I focused on applied and computational statistics, Bayesian inference, simulation, and optimization. Typically, I find the intersection of statistical methodology development with tangible applications to be the most interesting research problems (for example developing new Bayesian models for education monitoring or investigating the relationships between climate change and health). 

Take a look at the [Portfolio](https://ameerd.github.io/portfolio) and [CV](https://ameerd.github.io/CV) tabs to learn a little more about my academic and professional experiences!

A Little About Me Personally
======
Outside of my work, I like to hike and bike in the summer, skate in the winter, and play squash or tennis whenever I can. I'm also into board games, my switch, and really enjoy a good book. 

Thanks for reading!
