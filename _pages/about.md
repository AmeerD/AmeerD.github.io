TEST!!!
Hello, my name is Ameer. I am currenty a MSc candidate at the University of Toronto in the Department of Statistical Sciences. My primary areas of interest are computational statistics, simulation, and optimization. I find the intersection of these areas to be particularly interesting (for example using randomness to solve optimization problems). I also happen to have a soft spot for graphical models and networks in general. Since joining UofT, I have been exploring my areas of interest in the context of operations research.

Previously, I completed my BMath at the University of Waterloo where I studied a mix of statistics, computer science, and finance. My school, co-op, and extracurricular experiences during my time at UW had me explore subject areas including computer vision, text mining, venture capital, and predictive modelling with financial data. Take a look at the portfolio and CV tabs to learn a little more about my academic and professional experiences!

A Little About Me Personally
======
Outside of school, I like to bike in the summer, skate in the winter, and play squash whenever I can. I'm also into board games and absolutely adore my Nintendo Switch - before you ask, Fire Emblem is easily my favourite game. Since coming back to Toronto, I've also been on a culinary adventure. One of my favourite things about this city is that there is always an interesting restaurant, tea shop, or dessert place to sample...bonus points if it's an ice cream place! Given my love of desserts, I have attempted to bake though the results range between promising to disastrous depending on who you ask.

Thanks for reading! Hope you found something interesting on here!
