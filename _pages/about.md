**Note: I am currently on the job market for positions starting in Fall 2026/Winter 2027. I'm conducting a small search for junior faculty  positions and a broader search for postdoc opportunities. Please do reach out if you know of an opportunity that I may be a good fit for. Thanks!**

Hello, my name is Ameer. I am a fourth-year PhD Candidate in the Department of Biostatistics at the University of Washington supervised by Professors Daniela Witten and Jon Wakefield. My research focuses on developing strategies for selective inference and predictive model uncertainty quantification that are applicable in complex data settings and/or with small sample sizes. I also actively work on collaborative projects in demography and global development that aim to estimate various population indicators (e.g., mortality, fertility, and school completion rates) at national and subnational levels.

Previously, I worked as a research and data consultant for the [Global Education Monitoring Report](https://en.unesco.org/gem-report/) at UNESCO. I completed my Master of Science in Statistical Sciences at the University of Toronto and my Bachelor of Mathematics at the University of Waterloo. 

For more about my academic and professional experiences, please see my [Portfolio](https://ameerd.github.io/portfolio) and [CV](https://ameerd.github.io/files/Ameer_D_CV.pdf). I am always looking for interesting collaborations so if you have a project in mind, please do feel free to reach out!

A Little About Me Personally
======
Outside of my work, I like to ice skate, play squash, run, bake, and really enjoy a [good book](https://ameerd.github.io/readinglist).  

Thanks for reading!
