I've been inspired by the recent trend of people posting their reading lists. Currently I've just listed my favourites though in time hopefully this will morph into more of a timeline of my reading habits. The plan is to read (at least) one book a month and keep that going as long as I can.
Note: This is a no research paper zone, just leisure reading (and maybe a textbook or two) :)
