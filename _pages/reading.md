I've been inspired by the recent trend of people posting their list favourite books. Currently I've just listed my favourites though in time hopefully this will morph into more of a timeline of my reading habits.
Note: This is a no research paper zone, just leisure reading (and maybe a textbook or two) :)

* The Wanderers, Meg Howrey
* Introduction to Linear Optimization, Dimitris Bertsimas & John N. Tsitsiklis
  * I read half of this one in an LPs course so at some point I want to read the other half
